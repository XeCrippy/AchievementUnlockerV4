# RGH Achievement, Avatar Award, and Gamer Picture Unlocker

# DO NOT USE. CURRENTLY CAUSING PROFILES TO CORRUPT. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN USING JUST THE PLUGIN BUT WHEN CALLING IT FROM THE C# TOOL SOMETHING IS NOT BEING HANDLED PROPERLY.

*If your profile corrupts, clear your cache and redownload it. 
* Use this plugin for now. It works fine https://github.com/XeCrippy/XSolaceUnlocker

Information:
* Uses a plugin to expose XUserWriteAchievements and XUserAwardAvatarAssets because I haven't been able to reverse it in c#
* nothing needs to be done as far as setting the plugin through dashlaunch
* it will load into memory when you click "Unlock Achievements" or "Unlock Avatar Awards".
* It's not needed for the gamer pictures because I found the XAM function it uses
* This one does not search memory for the game specific function like the previous version
