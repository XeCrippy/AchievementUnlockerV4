# RGH Achievement, Avatar Award, and Gamer Picture Unlocker

[s]Information:
* Uses a plugin to expose XUserWriteAchievements and XUserAwardAvatarAssets because I haven't been able to reverse it in c#
* nothing needs to be done as far as setting the plugin through dashlaunch
* it will load into memory when you click "Unlock Achievements" or "Unlock Avatar Awards".
* It's not needed for the gamer pictures because I found the XAM function it uses
* This one does not search memory for the game specific function like the previous version[/s]
